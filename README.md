## API Used

[Tetra Channel API](https://tetr.io/about/api/)

## Outcomes

Here are some of the things I learned while developing this application:

1. Making API calls with [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).
2. Use of react `useEffect` hook.
3. Routing with [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) (static and dynamic).
4. Pagination.
5. Defining prop types of components.
6. Make pages responsive with CSS media queries.
7. Fixing CORS issues by creating a proxy server in between the web client (React) and the API.
